          Happy BirthdaY To My babygirl,It‚Äôs not just your birthday that makes today special ‚Äî it‚Äôs you.
          You honestly make everything feel a little lighter, a little brighter, just by being around.
          I‚Äôm really lucky to have someone like you in my life
          I hope this year brings you everything your heart quietly wishes for and maybe a little extra happiness from
          the people who care about you (you know, like me).
          Stay amazing, you deserve all the love today and always.
          <br>
